## Usage

    In the Project , we will:

    - Implement the following interactions:
        
        A classic two-person game. Players start each round by saying, 
        ‚Äúrock, paper, scissors, shoot!‚Äù On ‚Äúshoot,‚Äù each player holds out their fist for rock,
        flat hand for paper, or their index and middle finger for scissors. Rock crushes scissors,
        scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. See who wins each round!

            Players start each round by choosing, ‚Äúrock, paper, scissors" 

            Begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‚ÄòRock‚Äô, ‚ÄòPaper‚Äô or ‚ÄòScissors‚Äô.
            
            Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".
            
            Make your function‚Äôs playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).

            Write a NEW function called game(). Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
